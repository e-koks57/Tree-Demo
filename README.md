Introduction

The File System Simulator is a simple console-based application that simulates the functionality of a basic hierarchical file system. It allows users to create and navigate through a tree-like structure of folders using commands similar to those in a command-line interface (CLI). This application is implemented in Java and provides a hands-on way to interact with and understand tree data structures.

Features

The application offers the following functionalities:

Create Subfolders (mkdir <name>):
Allows users to create a new subfolder under the current folder.
Navigate into a Subfolder (cd <name>):
Users can navigate to a specific subfolder by its name.
Navigate to the Parent Folder (cd ..):
Enables users to move back to the parent folder or root directory.
List Subfolders (ls):
Displays all the subfolders within the current folder.
Exit (exit):
Exits the simulator.
Help:
The application starts by showing a list of available commands.
Purpose and Motivation

This application was developed as a learning tool to:

Understand Tree Data Structures: The hierarchical folder structure mirrors a tree data structure, helping users and developers grasp concepts like nodes, parent-child relationships, and traversals.
Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Building this simulator provides a practical approach to solving real-world problems by modeling abstract data structures into an interactive system.
Simulate a CLI Environment: The commands mimic standard CLI file system operations, familiarizing users with basic file navigation and management concepts.
